# Spam-Ham-Email-Classification-Using-Multinomial-Naive-Bayes--using-NLP
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify messages (such as emails or SMS) as either "spam" or "ham" (not spam). The classification is based on the content of the messages, and the model is trained to identify patterns that distinguish spam from non-spam messages.
